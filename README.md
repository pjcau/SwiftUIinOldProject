# SwiftUIinOldProject
Implements SwiftUI inside old Project less iOS13 or with Storyboard. 


This project is created with xCode11 seed 2, without SwiftUI with deployment target 10.0. So it's work without swiftUI until io13 and also the dependency like QGrid.
On a device with iOS13 it shows a View with SwiftUI with a dependency.
